# rsa-encryption-java-demo

I present here a simple demonstration of the RSA encryption algorithm.

The RSA algorithm itself is implemented in Java on server side using a custom implementation of the extended Euclid algorithm.

Both public and private key are added as attribute to the current session.

Javascript is used for display only with AJAX requests to the server.

To launch the demo run command `mvn spring-boot:run` in project directory.

When the appliocation has started open a browser and hit URL `localhost:8080/rsa`.
